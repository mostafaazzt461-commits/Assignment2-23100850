Answers and Explanations OS Assignment 2

1) process_creation.c
   - Demonstrates process creation using fork().
   - fork() creates a duplicate process. The return value is:
       * 0 in the child process
       * >0 in the parent (the child's PID)
       * <0 on failure
   - The program prints whether it is the child or parent and shows the PID with getpid().

2) Background process / stopping / resuming (lab commands)
   - These are shell commands demonstrated in the lab (not separate C programs).
   - Start a background process:
       sleep 300 &
   - List jobs:
       jobs
   - Find process ID:
       ps aux | grep sleep
   - Stop a process:
       kill <PID>
   - Pause a process:
       kill -STOP <PID>
   - Resume a process:
       kill -CONT <PID>

3) file1.c and file2.c (Linker example)
   - file1.c defines a function `hello()` which prints a message.
   - file2.c declares `hello()` and calls it from main().
   - Compiling both files together causes the linker to combine the object code so that references to `hello` are resolved.
   - Compile with:
       gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program
   - Run with:
       ./output_program

4) simple_program.c (Loader / ldd example)
   - A simple C program that prints a line.
   - Compile with:
       gcc simple_program.c -o simple_program
   - Use ldd to see dynamic libraries:
       ldd simple_program
   - The loader is responsible for loading the program into memory and mapping shared libraries at runtime. `ldd` shows which shared libraries are dynamically linked.

5) Makefile (provided with the project)
   - Builds the programs:
       make all
   - Cleans the build:
       make clean

6) License
   - MIT License file is included (LICENSE).

7) README.md
   - A project README based on common templates (title, description, build/run, license, contact).

This file and the source files reproduce Lab 5 examples exactly as in the lab document.
